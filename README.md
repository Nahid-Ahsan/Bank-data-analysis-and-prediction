## In this project, analyze the Bank dataset and create a classification algorithm with full end feature engineering and EDA. 


**Data Quality Check:**
- Verify the data preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and completeness.
- Examine the data distribution, summary statistics, and visualizations to confirm that the EDA has been performed effectively.

**Feature Engineering:**
- Evaluate the feature engineering process and its impact on model performance.

**Model Evaluation:**
- Review the model selection process, including the choice of Decision Tree and Naive Bayes.
- Examine the model evaluation results, focusing on accuracy, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

**Interpretability:**
- Assess the clarity of model interpretation and the significance of individual features.
- Ensure that the models' predictions align with the real-world context of the banking data.

**Recommendations:**
- Evaluate the actionable recommendations and their alignment with the insights gained from the analysis.

By following this approach and reviewing the above aspects, we aim to provide the bank with valuable insights and recommendations to enhance its strategies and decision-making based on the data analysis and classification predictions.
